This repo features a project management app from the Udemy course "Understanding TypeScript" by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. It demonstrates TypeScript features like enums, interfaces, abstract classes, decorators, modules, and singletons. Inspired by React, it includes state management and drag-and-drop for projects with validation.
